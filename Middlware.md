> *Middleware is a design pattern to eloquently add <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">cross cutting concerns</mark> like logging, handling authentication, or gzip compression without having many code contact points.*

> Middleware is generally pretty flexible. Some middleware is passive such as logging middleware. Other middleware such as gzip compression can perform transforms on the request or response body. Middleware can add HTTP headers, add internal flags for use by your business logic, etc. Itâ€™s an implementation of the [pipelines design pattern](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/ParallelPatterns/PatternLanguage/AlgorithmStructure/Pipeline.htm).
