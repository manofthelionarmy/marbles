# Notes:
### Ch. 1
- There's a thing called a *structured-procrastinator*. We do get things done, but never the big tasks with deadlines. We get other smaller tasks done to avoid the bigger task.
### Ch 2.
- Perfectionism can lead to procrastination. We put things off because we want to do them perfectly, at the perfect time, and maybe overwhelm by the amount of perfect we have to do. When, in fact, in reality adequate effort can get the task done. 
	- When the deadline is approaching quick, we tend to get things done in a hurried state, or via urgency. This reminds me of this *"urgency-grid"* kind of thing. Oh, it has a name, it's called the *Eisenhower Matrix*:

- We also need to hack ourselves by creating a sense of urgency to get things done.
### Ch 3.
- Todo lists are very important. Pschologically, it can give us a sense of progress and help us not feel like we are lazy couch potatoes. 
	- We must break things done into concrete, measurable goals.
	- We may even have to make small goals to ensure we aren't distracted.
	- It is advised we make our todo list at night. I don't personally like that, because I then would make unrealistic todo list to get a bunch of things done. 
		- However, maybe a way to combat this is do things step by step, or in other words, focus on big task that has a sense of urgency.
