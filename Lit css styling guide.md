# Notes:
- I get no autocompletion when using css tagging via lit library.
- Maybe I can get this solved with using lunarvim, which hopefully allows context switching based on inline css.
- I don't know what this function does. I think it converts it to CSSResults, which is an abstraction specific to lit. 
- I don't understand the safety concern, I think it means to make sure the css comes from a trusted source. I'm not using a cdn to do this, but I'm using my own css files, which is a trusted source.
