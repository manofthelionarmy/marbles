> An interface for recording graphical operations.

> Canvas objects are used in creating Picture objects, which can themselves be used with a SceneBuilder to build a Scene. In normal usage, however, this is all handled by the framework.

- In other words, it's an abstraction. It's an interface that records the graphical operations needed for rasterization.
