[Nvim Lsp Zero - Github](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim)

# Notes:
- This is a nvim package that bundles all of the boiler plate for nvim-cmp and nvim-lspconfig to play nicely.
- This pairs well with mason.nvim, meaning we can install lsp servers from inside nvim.
## Follow Up:
- Create a branch of neovim config and implement this package along mason.nvim and try to setup native lsp. And then maybe try other cool stuff.
