# Notes:
> Property names that are prefixed with `--`, like `--example-name`, represent _custom properties_ that contain a value that can be used in other declarations using the [`var()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var) function.

> Custom properties are <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">scoped to the element(s) they are declared on</mark>, and participate in the cascade: the value of such a custom property is that from the declaration decided by the cascading algorithm.
