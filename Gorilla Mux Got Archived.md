# Notes:
- I just learned the entire Gorilla Mux toolkit got archived today. Darn. 
- The course I was following on udemy is using gorilla websockets. I'll use the gorilla websockets package still so that I can learn.
- I do have Trevor's websocket course and I think he was using a different websocket package. I'll go take a look at that later, or after I wrap up this course.
	- UPDATE: he does use gorilla websockets too in the beginning then uses another package.
- Here are some alternative packages I found that are still being maintained:
	- https://github.com/nhooyr/websocket
	- https://github.com/gobwas/ws
- I did read that the package is pretty stable and hasn't changed a lot in the last 5 years, but I don't know how stable it will be in the future.
- Hopefully someone forks this repo and continues the work.
- Here's the post where the maintainer announces that they'll archive the project:

- For routing, chi is really good. I think there are other apps, but chi gets the job done and it's really simple.

- I asked the instructor from my udemy course, and he shared this article with me (I'm not sure why I couldn't find it on the internet).
