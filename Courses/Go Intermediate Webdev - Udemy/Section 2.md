# Notes:
- This section was more so about setup. We are using MariaDB as our database. 
- The instructor installed MariaDB locally on their machine, and is using a free ui to manage the db.
- I instead opted into using a docker container and found a starter docker-compose yaml for mariadb.
- I also found an open source db ui manager called DB Beaver.
