# Notes:
- I looked into Section 1 and looked into what the course offers, how it will be taught, etc.
- Nothing out of the norm, it offers to teach the theory about typescript and everything we need to know inorder to code in it.
- The selling point is that it will teach us via React and Express app projects (project based learning).
	- However, it's more towards the end of the course where we incorporate Typescript in Webpack, third party libraries, React and Express.
- Here's the course outline:

  - One thing I do notice, in comparison to the book Learning Type Script, it covers configuration later.
  - Learning Typescript, obviously, also covers core Typescript, including generics, classes and interfaces, but it doesn't appear to talk about Decorators.
 - Benefit of the video, can follow along.  
 - Benefit of the book: more concise detail and refereable. Better than playing a video over and over and reading a transcript.
 - However, Academind has a good track record of covering a great amount of detail within a topic and presents the essentials in a very easy to follow manner.
 - I could instead: read about the topics in the book and also cross reference with the video if I need: more examples, and more exercises.
