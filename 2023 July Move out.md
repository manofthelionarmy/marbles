## Questions:
- What will happen if I want to move out?
	- Depends on the lease. If you sign on the lease, we all agreed that you must stay on it for the term of the lease (i.e. one year). Gives us time to prepare and find our own place.
- If house is part of an HOA, is the cost part of the rent?
## Follow Up:
### 2023-07-06:
