# Notes:
> MariaDB Server is one of the most popular **open source <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">relational databases</mark>**. Itâ€™s **made by the original developers of MySQL** and guaranteed to stay open source. It is part of most cloud offerings and the default in most Linux distributions.
- Key takeaways of MariaDB is that it is a free open source relational db created by the original developers of MySQL.
- My first time was using it during the Go Intermediate Web dev course on Udemy.
## Questions:

## Follow Up:
- Maybe do another project to use more of mariadb. 
- Maybe figure out mariadb's capabilities and advanced features and compare and contrast against other open source databases (Postgres, Mongo, etc).
