# Notes:
> This is a basic layout for Go application projects. It's **`not an official standard defined by the core Go dev team`**; however, it is a set of common historical and emerging project layout patterns in the Go ecosystem.

> **`If you are trying to learn Go or if you are building a PoC or a simple project for yourself this project layout is an overkill. Start with something really simple instead (a single` main.go`file and`go.mod `is more than enough).`** 
- As said, the go dev team never made an official standard for the way go projects should be structured. This gives us developers the freedom to structure it in a way that makes sense depending on our project.
- However, as more and more go projects were being developed, a lot of common patterns were arising. This repo captures those common patterns.
- I do appreciate they do warn that this project layout is overkill when you are building a  poc or a simple project. This project layout will serve as a great guide if the code base of your project grows.
- There is this book that points this out, and gives great advice on how to structure your go projects:
