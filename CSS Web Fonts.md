# Notes:
Web fonts allow Web designers to use fonts that are not installed on the user's computer.

When you have found/bought the font you wish to use, just include the font file on your web server, and it will be automatically downloaded to the user when needed.

Your "own" fonts are defined within the CSS `@font-face` rule.
