# Notes:
> In [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), a **replaced element** is an element whose representation is outside the scope of CSS; they're external objects whose representation is independent of the CSS formatting model.
> Put in simpler terms, they're <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">elements whose contents are not affected by the current document's styles</mark>. The position of the replaced element can be affected using CSS, but not the contents of the replaced element itself.
