# Notes:
A compiler and an interpreter are both software programs that process and execute code, but they differ in how they accomplish this task. Here's a breakdown of the key differences between a compiler and an interpreter:

Compiler:
- A compiler is a program that translates the entire source code of a program into an executable form before it is run.
- It takes the source code as input and produces an output file (often an executable binary) that can be directly executed by the computer's operating system.
- The compilation process involves multiple stages, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
- Once the compilation is complete, the resulting executable file can be executed repeatedly without the need for recompilation, unless changes are made to the source code.
- Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, Java (to bytecode), and Rust.

Interpreter:
- An interpreter is a program that reads and executes the source code of a program directly, line by line, without translating it into an executable form beforehand.
- It takes the source code as input and processes and executes it immediately, without generating a separate executable file.
- The interpretation process involves scanning and parsing the source code, followed by the execution of the interpreted instructions.
- Interpreters typically work on a piece of code at a time, executing it and producing the corresponding output or side effects.
- Interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Perl.

Key differences:
1. Execution Model: A compiler translates the entire source code into an executable form before execution, while an interpreter processes and executes the code line by line.

2. Output: A compiler produces a standalone executable file that can be executed independently, while an interpreter executes the code directly without generating a separate executable.

3. Performance: Compiled code generally tends to execute faster because it has been optimized during the compilation process. Interpreted code may have some performance overhead due to the need for parsing and executing the code at runtime.

4. Portability: Interpreted code is generally more portable since it can be executed on any system with the appropriate interpreter. Compiled code, especially when compiled to a specific architecture or platform, may be less portable.

5. Development Workflow: Compilation is typically a separate step in the development workflow, requiring explicit compilation before execution. With an interpreter, code changes can be tested immediately without the need for a separate compilation step.

6. Error Reporting: Compilers often provide more detailed error messages during compilation, helping to catch syntax errors, type mismatches, and other issues upfront. Interpreters can provide immediate feedback on errors encountered during execution.

In practice, there are hybrid approaches that combine aspects of both compilers and interpreters, such as just-in-time (JIT) compilation, where code is compiled on the fly during execution, providing a balance between performance and flexibility.
