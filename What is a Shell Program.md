# Notes:
> A shell is software that provides an interface for an operating system’s users to provide access to the kernel’s services.

> On Unix-based or Linux-based operating systems, a shell can be invoked through the shell command in the command line interface (CLI), allowing users to direct operations through computer commands, text or script.

> A **shell** is a [software](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/software.htm) program used to interpret [commands](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/command.htm) that are [input](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/input.htm) via a [command-line interface](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/commandi.htm), enabling users to interact with a computer by giving it instructions.

- Historically, computers didn't have desktops or graphical userinterfaces. A pieced of hardware called a terminal will be hooked up to a computer and runs the shell program. The terminal will then accept our input, which allows us to type out shell commands.
- An analogy is gameboy or console emulators, which emulate actual real pieces of hardware (a ga meboy, a PS3, gamecube, etc) on our own computers.
- In modern computers, we will have a desktop and applications with an ui that lets us interact with a computer. We will then have terminal emulator that emulates the features and capabilites of terminal of the past (with additonal features given there are a lot of terminal emulators that compete against one another). These terminal emulators let us interact with our computer while letting us still use our desktop.
- Like there are different terminal emulators, there are different shell programs with their own abstractions (or maybe even domain) and features/capabilities that allow us to interact with a computer's abstractions (i.e., filesystem), hardware, or even install third party applications/libraries via  a package manager (a piece a software we can interact with via the shell). 
- The most common one we see is bash, or the Bourne Again SHell, Z-shell, etc.
- Z-shell is an extension of Bash, meaning it provides it same features and additional,convienent and helpful ones ontop of the ones bash provided out of the box.
