# Notes:
- To clone into a directory just follow git clone with the name of the directory. If the directory doesn't exist, git will create it.
- If we are in a directory, we can clone its content and make the directory a git directory by doing this:
```bash
git clone <repo url> .
``` 
- The shell interpreter knows that means our current directory, hence why it works.
- The use case for this is when I'm using lunar vim and they auto generate a `~/config/lvim`. I want to clone the content of my repo into this auto generated directory and replace my `config.lua`
- Unfortunately, this only works if we have a completely empty directory.
- I should make a installation script for my lunar config. I want to remove the autogenerated config.lua and create a symbolic link between `~/config/lvim/config.lua` to my repo. But I can always do that another time.
