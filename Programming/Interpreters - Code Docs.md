# Summary:
- Interperters directly execute a program written in a programming or scripting language.
- It has three distinct strategies it can use and either can accomplish the goal of directly executing a program.
- Overall, it reads the source program (code) one line at a time and then does some execution.

# Notes:
> In [computer science](https://codedocs.org/what-is/computer-science "Computer science"), an **interpreter** is a [computer program](https://codedocs.org/what-is/computer-program "Computer program") that directly executes instructions written in a [programming](https://codedocs.org/what-is/programming-language "Programming language") or [scripting language](https://codedocs.org/what-is/scripting-language "Scripting language"), without requiring them previously to have been [compiled](https://codedocs.org/what-is/compiler "Compiler") into a [machine language](https://codedocs.org/what-is/machine-language "Machine language") program. An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:
>1.  Parse the [source code](https://codedocs.org/what-is/source-code "Source code") and perform its behavior directly;
>2.  [Translate](https://codedocs.org/what-is/translator-computing "Translator (computing)") source code into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute this;
>3.  Explicitly execute stored precompiled code[[1]](https://codedocs.org/what-is/interpreter-computing#cite_note-1) made by a [compiler](https://codedocs.org/what-is/compiler "Compiler") which is part of the interpreter system.

## What is  a translator?
> A **translator** or **programming language processor** is a generic term that can refer to anything that converts code from one computer language into another

## How is an interpreter a translator?
> The [interpreter](https://codedocs.org/what-is/interpreter-computing "Interpreter (computing)") is similar to a compiler, as it is a translator used to convert [high-level programming language](https://codedocs.org/what-is/high-level-programming-language "High-level programming language") to [low-level programming language](https://codedocs.org/what-is/low-level-programming-language "Low-level programming language"). The difference is that it converts the program one line of code at a time and reports errors when detected, while also doing the conversion.
