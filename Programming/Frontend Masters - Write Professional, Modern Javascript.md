# Notes:
- This course goes more in depth than other javascript courses. It may worth to look around online or other resources that include these topics.
- I looked through the courses in this learning path and it looks like the guy who wrote the `You Don't Know Js` series did the books. He may be doing courses on his book.
-  For Javascript, the hard parts, it looks like it's done by `Code Smith`. They have a YouTube Channel, and there is a playlist with the same title. I'm not sure if it matches all of the content in frontend masters, or if the course was exactly redone, but here's the link: [Javascript, The Hard Parts - Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWrQZnG8l0E5hMTpzCK8WjP3nJ93jUEyk)
	- I just realized the videos are super long (some ranging 1-2hours). It looks around ~20 hours of content. In contrast, the frontend masters course is 6 hours and it maybe a condensed version of the youtube playlist.
 - There are also courses in this learning path built around functional programming. I have access to a Javascript Functional Programming Course on Udemy.
	 - Omg, I found the book. The author does the same thing in the `You Don't Know Js` series, he open sources the book:
	   [Functional Light Programming](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS)
- [Javascript the Recent Parts](https://github.com/kelasol/javascript-the-recent-parts)
	- Not a book, but looks like the bullet points from the front end masters course in the learning path. Nevertheless, I can look up these terms over the interenet.
- Fortunately, the courses from the link are clickable and take you to the course page. There, they give more detail as well as the table of contents, which I can then use to google the topics covered in each lesson.
