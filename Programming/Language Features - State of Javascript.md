[Language Features - State of Javascript 2021]
# Summary:
- This contains javascript language features (and practices) that are used or known about in the javascript community, according to this survey.
- It is worth it to learn them and develop a more deeper understanding of javascript. Frontend masters helps teach some of these concepts, but I wonder if they are available in `You don't know JS` series, Eloquent Javascript, or `Secrets of a Javascript Ninja`.
