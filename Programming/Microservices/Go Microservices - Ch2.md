# Notes:
- This goes over 3 things:
	- Go basics
	- Project Structure
	- Scaffolding an example application
- By Go basics, the author is not referring to syntax or fundamentals of the go language.
	- Instead, it focues on standard advice or principles:
		- Always follow the official guidelines
		- Follow the style used in the standard library
		- Do not try to apply the ideas from other languages to Go
			- Tbh, I don't know much about this. I'm not sure what other ideas of other programming languages may not fit into Go.
- Other basics the author refers to is writing idiomatic Go Code.
	- This is better covered in *100 Go Mistakes*.
- The last tip is on project structure or scaffolding, and distingues between `internal`, `pkg`, and `cmd`. All of which can be found in [[Golang Project Layout]]
- Again, project scaffolding is better covered in *100 Go Mistakes*.
## Questions:

## Follow Up:
- Review project scaffolding in *100 Go Mistakes* and Hexagonal Architecture.
- Make the links into their own pages.
- May have to implement code in chatper 2. I guess it continues off with the code example from chapter 2 into chatper 3.
