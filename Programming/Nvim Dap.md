# Summary:
- These are the guides that I used or will go through.
- It looks like the developer experience improved a lot for dap since I've lasted used it.
- I can't find how to add variables to a watch list, however.
	- Oh wait!! go into insert mode on the watches buffer and type the variable I want to watch
	- to remove watched expressions, delete them with 'd' in normal mode wherever the cursor is
