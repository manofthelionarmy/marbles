# Notes:
- I was reading the Nodejs in Action, 2nd Edition book. The book was published in 2017. It was talking about serial and parallel control flow. It mentioned this package to use in order to implement serial control flow. 
- The package they mentioned was last updated (a new major or minor version was released) in 2017.
- In 2018, async and await was made available in the EMCA specification and implemented in the V8 runtime. I believe that async and await did away with the package mentioned in the book.
- The article shared above talks about Node.js control flow and what async and await means. It also mentions generators and iterators, and I wonder how these Javascript-language capabilities/features related to async and await. It will be worth reading and drawing out the essentials from that article.
- Anyways, given these findings, I'll skip the section within the book that talks about serial control flow and instead favor learning about Promises and async and await. The You Don't Know Js series may be worth it.
