# Notes:
> `chi` is a lightweight, idiomatic and composable router for building Go HTTP services. It's especially good at helping you write large REST API services that are kept maintainable as your project grows and changes. `chi` is built on the new `context` package introduced in Go 1.7 to handle signaling, cancelation and request-scoped values across a handler chain.
