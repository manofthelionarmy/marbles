Profiling a Go application that is not a web application follows a similar process to profiling a web application. Here's an overview of the steps to profile a standalone Go application:

1. **Import the Profiling Packages**: Import the necessary profiling packages in your Go application. The commonly used package is `runtime/pprof`. Include this import in your codebase.

2. **Add Profiling Code**: Insert the necessary code to start and stop profiling at specific points in your application. Use the `StartCPUProfile` and `StopCPUProfile` functions from the `runtime/pprof` package. For example:

   ```go
   import (
       "os"
       "runtime/pprof"
   )

   func main() {
       // ...

       // Start CPU profiling
       cpuProfile, err := os.Create("cpu_profile.prof")
       if err != nil {
           // handle error
       }
       defer cpuProfile.Close()
       if err := pprof.StartCPUProfile(cpuProfile); err != nil {
           // handle error
       }
       defer pprof.StopCPUProfile()

       // ... Your application code ...

       // Stop CPU profiling

   }
   ```

   In this example, CPU profiling is started before the critical section of your code and stopped afterward.

3. **Run the Application**: Build and run your Go application as you would normally. Ensure that the application is running and executing the code you want to profile.

4. **Profile the Application**: While the application is running, the profiling code will generate a profiling output file. This file contains the profiling data that you can analyze.

5. **Analyze Profiling Data**: To analyze the profiling data, you can use the command-line tools provided by Go. The primary tool is `go tool pprof`, which allows you to interactively analyze the profiling data. Run the following command to analyze the CPU profile data, for example:

   ```bash
   go tool pprof cpu_profile.prof
   ```

   This will open an interactive shell where you can use commands like `top`, `list`, and `web` to explore the profiling data and identify performance bottlenecks.

6. **Optimize and Repeat**: Based on the analysis, optimize your code or make necessary improvements to address performance issues. Make changes to your application, rebuild, and rerun the profiling process to validate the impact of your optimizations.

Remember to profile your application in real-world scenarios or specific code sections that you suspect may be causing performance issues. This way, you can obtain accurate and meaningful profiling data that helps you identify and address performance bottlenecks in your Go application.
