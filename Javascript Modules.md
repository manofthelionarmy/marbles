# Notes:
- Back then, javascript code as a single file was maintainable. As web applications grew more complex given feature requests, there was a need to break apart the single javascript file into numerous files, each with encapsulated and exposed code.
- I.e., there was a need to *modularize* code.
- Back then, there was not a standardized module system in Javascript, hence why we have more than one module system.
	- More than one module system exists, with their own specification and implementation, and all were developed to solve the same problem: make it possible to have modules in javascript.
- The existing module systems are: 
	- Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) 
	- CommonJS
	- Universal Module Definition (UMD)
	- ES Modules
- ES Modules is now the official standard for Javascript

## Questions:
- Did ECMA International state that the ES Modules is the standard?
	- Yes, it's part of the ECMA standard or specification.
- What is ECMA?
	- It is a standard or specification that ensures interopability of client-side javascript across all browsers.
