The phrase "Linux operating system" is often used to refer to the combination of the Linux kernel and the GNU operating system utilities and libraries. It is a common misconception to refer to the entire system as just "Linux," but technically, the complete system is a combination of the Linux kernel and GNU software.

Here's a breakdown of the components:

1. Linux Kernel: The Linux kernel is the core component of the operating system. It is responsible for managing the system's resources, such as memory, processes, device drivers, and providing an interface for applications to interact with the hardware.

2. GNU Operating System: The GNU Project, initiated by Richard Stallman in the early 1980s, aimed to create a free and open-source operating system. The GNU operating system consists of a collection of software utilities and libraries, including the GNU C Library (glibc), GNU Core Utilities (coreutils), Bash (shell), GCC (compiler), and many more. These components provide essential functionality for running applications and interacting with the system.

When combined, the Linux kernel and the GNU operating system utilities form a complete operating system commonly referred to as "GNU/Linux" or simply "Linux." The Linux kernel provides the low-level functionality and hardware abstraction, while the GNU utilities and libraries provide the userland tools and environment necessary for running applications and interacting with the system.

It's worth noting that the term "Linux" is sometimes used more loosely to refer to the entire operating system, including both the kernel and the GNU software. However, to be technically accurate, it is important to recognize the distinction between the Linux kernel and the GNU operating system utilities when discussing the complete system.
