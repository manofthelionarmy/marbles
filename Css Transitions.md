# Notes:
> CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.
- It will listen for the value we are modifying via javascript and then apply the smooth transition/animation.
- There are different ways to set a transition:
	- one by one, transition-property, transition-duration, transition-delay, and transition-timing-function.
	- You can add a comma delimited list of css properties in transition-property.
	- when setting `transition` css property: <transition-property> <transition-duration> <transition-timing-function> <transition-delay>. 
		- This can also be comma delimited per transition property to have more fine grained control of when transitions for a property begins.
