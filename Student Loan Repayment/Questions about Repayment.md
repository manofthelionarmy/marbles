### 2023-08-21:
- I logged back into my nelnet account. I read some of the stuff to under stand my repayment options.
- In order to make an extra payment on top of my monthly payment and to not advance it to the next due date, I have to set up a `Special Payment Instructions`
	- I can also do a `One Time Payment` if I want to pay to a specific loan or group (i.e. a group is loans grouped on similar characteristics.)
 - As we can see in the screen shot, the `Special Payment Instructions` is a dropdown option under `Payments`:

 - When clicking on `Special Payment Options`: 
![[Pasted image 20230821191443.png]]
- We see we can tick off a box called `Don't advance due date`. 
- This ensures I can pay a lot more than I owe in the monthly payment, but I'm not sure which loan it will go to. 
- Based on the standard allocation special payment instruction:
> Any excess amount you pay beyond your current amount due will be **applied across all loans in this account starting with the highest interest rate**
- That means it will be applied across all loans starting with the highest interest rate. How will it be distributed then? Will it be distributed, or will all of the payment go into the highest interest rate (i.e. I payed $200 extra, the loan with 4.66% is the highest and there's $2000 remaining on the balance, hence after the payment there's $1800)? What if the loan with the highest interest rate has an accrued amount? Say my monthly payment is $300, my extra payment is $100, I don't advance to the next due date, and the accrued amount for the loan with the highest rate is $400 while having a principal amount of $2000? Does that mean my monthly payment will reduce the accrued amount to $100 and then my excess payment will knock it down to $0 and the $2000 loan will remain?
- What do they mean by a one-time payment? Does this mean non-recurring and I don't only literally get a "one-time" payment that I use up and can never do again?
	- I'm asking because I do want to pay some loans in a lump sum.
- It says I can make a one-time payment to override the `Special Payment Instructions`. Can I make multiple one-time payments towards different loans?
	- My scenario is that I want to target different loans.
- Here's more info about this stuff from nelnet:
	- If you want to pay more than is due (an excess payment) and specify how it is applied, you can provide us with one-time or recurring special payment instructions:
	- **One-Time Special Payment Instructions**
	    - Select Make a Payment from the Payments menu, and then select Pay by Group. Enter payment amounts to apply to one or more of your loan groups. Follow the remaining steps to confirm your payment to submit it.
	- **Recurring Special Payment Instructions**
	    - Select Special Payment Instructions from the Payments menu. Select a recurring special payment instruction from the drop-down menu to apply to future payments and submit the request.
- A question is, how do I do a one-time special payment instruction without advancing the due date, do I have that option?
- I think this answers this:
	- **You also have the option to instruct us to not advance your due date more than one month, as a one-time or recurring special payment instruction. By selecting this option, your due date will only advance a single month, even though you have paid more than the current amount due. If your account is already paid ahead, selecting this option will keep your due date from advancing further, or [Contact Us](https://www.nelnet.com/contact/) if you want your regular monthly payment amount to be due the next month.**
- Upon checking the UI:

- Nice, that's very easy. 
## Questions:
- How do I set up a repayment plan?
- Where do I apply for repayment plans?
- I read online I can make an additional payment on top of making my monthly payment, for example I paid $300 for my monthly payment and I want to pay an additional $100. I don't want the payment to advance the due date, what process do I need to follow to make sure the additional payment I make doesn't do that? Can I pick which loan/principle amount I can pay?
- How do I do a lump sum payment? Say I wanted to get a head start and pay off one of my loans? How do I do that? Is there a process I must follow?
- Can I change my repayment plan and increase the payment per month at a later date?
- What is a one-time payment? Does that mean non-recurring and I can manually make more than one one-time payment?
