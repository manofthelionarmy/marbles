# Notes:
Go provides a set of built-in command-line tools to help with various aspects of Go development. Here are some of the commonly used Go commands:

1. **go build**: Compiles the packages and dependencies in the current directory and creates an executable binary file. By default, the binary has the same name as the directory containing the entry point file.

2. **go run**: Compiles and runs a Go program in a single step. It is useful for quick testing or running small programs without explicitly building an executable.

3. **go test**: Runs tests associated with the current package. It automatically detects and executes test functions in files with names ending in `_test.go`. Test results and coverage reports are displayed in the console.

4. **go get**: Downloads and installs packages and their dependencies. It can fetch packages from remote repositories and make them available for use in your projects.

5. **go install**: Compiles and installs the package or packages into the Go workspace's `bin` and `pkg` directories. The installed executables and libraries can be used in other projects.

6. **go fmt**: Formats Go source code according to the Go formatting conventions. It automatically adjusts indentation, line breaks, and other formatting aspects to ensure consistent code style.

7. **go vet**: Examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs or potential issues. It can catch common programming mistakes and highlight potential errors or inefficiencies.

8. **go mod**: Manages Go modules, which are used for versioning and dependency management. Commands like `go mod init`, `go mod tidy`, and `go mod vendor` are used to initialize modules, update dependencies, and manage vendor directories, respectively.

9. **go doc**: Displays documentation for Go packages, functions, types, and methods. It can be used to retrieve the documentation locally or browse the Go documentation online.

10. **go clean**: Cleans the Go build cache and removes object files, cached test results, and other temporary build artifacts. It helps in starting a fresh build or reclaiming disk space.

11. **go env**: Prints Go environment information, including environment variables, build flags, and Go installation paths. It can be used to troubleshoot build or configuration issues.

12. **go tool**: Provides access to various Go tooling commands. Examples include `go tool pprof` for profiling Go programs, `go tool trace` for tracing program execution, and `go tool cover` for generating code coverage reports.

These are just a subset of the available Go commands. You can explore additional commands and their options by running `go help` or `go help <command>` to get detailed information about a specific command.
