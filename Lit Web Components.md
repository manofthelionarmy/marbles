# Notes:
- There's boilerplate involved when working with Web components.
- Lit is a library that acts as a wrapper around the Web components feature in browsers and enhances the developer experience by removing boilerplate usually involved in using web componets via a simple to use api.
- You can use web components in a vanilla way, and you can follow docs in MDN. When I took a look, the boiler plate to use this feature looked a bit overwhelming (imagine having to keep typing that out, oof).
- Lit is a lightweight library to simplify using web components.
