- I may have to rethink this, I'm currently getting the albums for the artist, default to their first album and then play the song.
- What if it isn't an able but a single? Do I default to their top tracks from their, or their next single?
- I think spotify plays songs they're featured in or a playlist that has similar artists...
- I guess one feature at a time.
- The `github/zmb3/spotify/v2` package also says if the device id isn't provided in the request, then the default device is the one that is currently connected to spotify. 
- I can add a feature to where the user can pick their device.
	- I don't want feature creep, but I'm writing this idea down so I don't forget it.
